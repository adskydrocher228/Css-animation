# Css-animation
<br>"I used transform: rotate() in my first index.html file and made it so the element spins like a circle with no borders."
<br>"In the second animation (index2.html), I made the element bounce in place like a basketball."
<br>"In the third animation (index3.html), I made it so that every 2-3 seconds the day changes to night and vice versa."
<br>
<br>"These animations are simple because, while studying CSS, I encountered the animation function for the first time."
